"use strict"; // treat all JS code as newer version
/*In JavaScript, "use strict" is a directive that activates strict mode, 
which is a way to enforce stricter parsing and error handling 
in your code. It was introduced in ECMAScript 5 (ES5) to catch common coding 
mistakes and unsafe actions, like assigning values to undeclared variables. 
When strict mode is enabled, JavaScript behaves in a more predictable way 
and helps developers avoid certain pitfalls. */
